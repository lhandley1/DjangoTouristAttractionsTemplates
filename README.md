# Django Tourist Attractions with Templates
## Summary
My first Django project assisted by Codeacedemy as part of the Build Python Web Apps with Django course. The task was to create dynamic website templates allowing users to see a list of tourist attractions in each state of the USA, visualised in a table format.

- A base template is used for common elements
  - Block content tags were used to share common elements between templates
  -  Block head tags were used to ensure each template had the same styling
- For loop tag used to iterate through each attraction in the dictionary
- Conditional tags were used to select specific data from the attractions dictionary
- Filters were used to adapt template variables
